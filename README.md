## **Background**

I designed the game a couple decades ago and it has since lived rent-free in my head. Thoughout the years it has been rewritten several times on many different languages and platforms. I even made a solver for it: https://github.com/ttahelenius/solver. Although many further features and levels exist in these other versions, I don't really expect to finish the project.
